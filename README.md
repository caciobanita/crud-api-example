# Crud Example of a React

There are actually two examples included here, for comparison, one using Redux and another using MobX

To run this:

````
yarn install
````

or

````
npm install
````

Then, run the two servers (they are actually the same, but running in different ports):

````
cd server
node server-redux.js
`````

````
cd server
node server-mobx.js
`````

After this, run in the root of the project

````
npm run start
````
